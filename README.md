# python releaser

this project is still very much so a WIP


it is based on [GoReleaser](https://github.com/goreleaser/goreleaser)


to run the cli during development, just clone the repo and install the
package as editable

```
pip install -e .
```

this will put `pyreleaser` on the path, e.g.

```
$ which pyreleaser
/Users/edaniszewski/.pyenv/shims/pyreleaser
```
